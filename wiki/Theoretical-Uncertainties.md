# 4) Theoretical Uncertainties

This section controls perturbation model, uncertainty magnitudes, distributions, and convergence thresholds for parameter classes.

## 4.1 Global perturbation and score-balance keys

| Keyword | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| max_std | 4 | Maximum deviation from the initial model, in standard deviations. For multiplicative parameters this is a log-space bound: the trusted range is `value * uncertainty**(±max_std)` (i.e. `[value / uncertainty**max_std, value * uncertainty**max_std]`), so the theory score exactly reaches `max_std**2` at the boundary. |
| freq_mode | "batch" | Frequency perturbation mode. Possible values: "batch" or "individual". Individual mode has not been thoroughly tested. |
| weight_theory | 1.0 | Raw theory contribution weight; normalized at runtime with weight_experiments. |
| weight_experiments | 1.0 | Raw experiment contribution weight; normalized at runtime with weight_theory. |
| specific_std | {} | Per-parameter override map for standard deviations. An entry overrides the global `std_<ptype>` for that parameter and governs the sampling scale, the scoring weight, **and** the perturbation boundaries (trusted range): a larger value widens the accepted bounds, a smaller one tightens them. Parameters without an entry fall back to the global `std_<ptype>`. |

## 4.2 Standard deviations (std_*)

| Keyword | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| std_we | 1.0 | Well and bimolecular fragments energy uncertainty (kcal/mol). |
| std_be | 1.5 | Barrier energy uncertainty (kcal/mol). |
| std_ifc | 1.1 | Individual vibrational frequency multiplicative uncertainty. Multiplicative factor. |
| std_bfc | 1.05 | Batch vibrational frequency multiplicative uncertainty. Multiplicative factor. |
| std_hrs | 0.1 | Hindered rotor uncertainty. Percentage. |
| std_if | 1.1 | Imaginary frequency multiplicative uncertainty. Multiplicative factor. |
| std_fact | 0.25 | Energy transfer factor uncertainty. Percentage. |
| std_pow | 0.075 | Energy transfer power uncertainty. Percentage. |
| std_epsilon | 0.1 | Lennard-Jones epsilon uncertainty. Percentage. |
| std_sig | 0.1 | Lennard-Jones sigma uncertainty. Percentage. |
| std_sfc | 2.0 | Symmetry-factor uncertainty for barrierless reactions. While the symmetry has no uncertainty, this parameter allows to scale the state density. Multiplicative factor. |
| std_mrc | 1.5 | Multi-dimensional rotor symmetry uncertainty. While the symmetry has no uncertainty, this parameter allows to scale the state density. Multiplicative factor. |

**Distribution restrictions.** Each parameter belongs to a category that constrains which sampling distribution (`distrib_*`) it may use:

- Multiplicative parameters (`if`, `sfc`, `mrc`, `bfc`, and the individual/batch frequencies) accept only `log-normal` or `log-uniform`.
- Additive (`we`, `be`, `pow`) and percentage (`hrs`, `sigma`, `epsilon`, `fact`) parameters accept only `uniform` or `normal`.

Any other combination cancels the run. In the GUI, only the valid distributions for a parameter's category are selectable.

For multiplicative parameters the theory-score distance is measured in log space as `ln(value / reference) / ln(uncertainty)`, so the penalty is symmetric under a factor and its inverse and consistent with the log-normal (log-space) perturbation of these parameters. Additive and percentage parameters keep their linear distance.

The perturbation, trust boundaries, and derivative steps for multiplicative parameters are all computed in log space consistently with this scoring:

- The trusted range is `value * uncertainty**(±max_std)`, so the theory score at the boundary equals `max_std**2` exactly.
- The log-normal sampling uses a log-space sigma of `ln(uncertainty)`, giving ±2/3/4 sigma coverage of 95.45% / 99.73% / 99.99% of samples within the corresponding `value * uncertainty**(±k)` range.

Note: with this log-space reconciliation the multiplicative trust region is wider than in earlier versions for `uncertainty > 1`; multiplicative-run results are not bit-for-bit comparable with pre-reconciliation runs. Additive and percentage parameters are unaffected.

<!-- ### 4.3 Distributions (distrib_*)
|---|---|---|
| distrib_we | "normal" | Distribution for well energies. Additive class: no log distributions allowed. |
| distrib_be | "normal" | Distribution for barrier energies. Additive class: no log distributions allowed. |
| distrib_ifc | "log-normal" | Distribution for individual frequencies. |
| distrib_bfc | "log-normal" | Distribution for batch frequencies. |
| distrib_hrs | "normal" | Distribution for hindered rotors. |
| distrib_if | "log-normal" | Distribution for imaginary frequencies. |
| distrib_fact | "normal" | Distribution for energy transfer factor. |
| distrib_pow | "normal" | Distribution for energy transfer power. Additive class restrictions apply. |
| distrib_epsilon | "normal" | Distribution for Lennard-Jones epsilon. |
| distrib_sig | "normal" | Distribution for Lennard-Jones sigma. |
| distrib_sfc | "log-normal" | Distribution for barrierless symmetry factor. |
| distrib_mrc | "log-normal" | Distribution for multi-dimensional rotor symmetry factor. | -->

## 4.3 Convergence thresholds (conv_*)

| Keyword | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| max_score | 4.0 | Convergence threshold. Maximum score for the best-model ensemble has to be lower. |
| score_conv | 2 | Convergence threshold. Average score for best-model ensemble has to be lower. |
| param_conv | 0.01 | Parameter-space convergence threshold used for both parameter values and standard deviations. For additive and percentage parameters it is a percentage (relative change), computed from the arithmetic per-generation mean/std. For multiplicative parameters (`if`, `sfc`, `mrc`, `bfc`, frequencies) the per-generation statistics are the **geometric** mean and geometric standard deviation, and genetic-algorithm convergence is measured in log space as `|ln(old / new)|` for both the mean and the standard deviation, consistent with their log-normal perturbation. |
| conv_we | 0.1 | Convergence threshold for well energies.(kcal/mol) |
| conv_be | 0.1 | Convergence threshold for barrier energies.(kcal/mol) |
| conv_pow | 0.01 | Convergence threshold for energy transfer power. |
